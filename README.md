<h2>About Me</h2>
So nice of you to take an interest in me and my work. So let's see..... I have entered the world of Computer Science quite recently(A little over a year and half as of Aug2020), before that has always been intrested in science and tecehnology, but frankly did not used to understand that. thenafter high school ende i did a course in C language and instantly feel in love with coding and now currently doing bachelors in Computer Application.<hr>
